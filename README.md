## A Little About Me
I am a Mom, wife, and soon to be grandma. I have three sons, one is married to a lovely women and two are at BYU provo. My husband is my best friend and works with Madison Fire Department. Our family has lived in Rexburg for about 13 years. We moved from Alaska expecting things to be a bit warmer and found that it can also be colder. We love adventure, almost any kind that gets us in nature. I started going back to school when our youngest son left for his mission. I began with some math, a food science class, and found that I enjoy data science. I have a degree in marketing from BYU and so fo now I am a non degree seeking student and hope to change that soon. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I served a mission in Uruguay a long time ago and love serving on campus in a YSA student ward.
